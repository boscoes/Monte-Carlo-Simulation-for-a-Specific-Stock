Hello, here you'll find some programming projects that I work on as a hobby! While I plan to pursue a career in finance, I enjoy coding different projects to further learn about this field.

This GitHub repo is a showcase of all my coding projects, some are more fun than other but either way they are incredibaly rewarding!!

If you want to contact or just to connect, feel free to reach out :)
